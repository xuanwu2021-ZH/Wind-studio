# Chat Reference

The chat domain spans reusable renderer modules, page-owned adapters, composer UI,
and the main-process message tree. There is no root
`@renderer/components/chat` barrel or generic `components/chat/adapters/`
directory; consumers import from the module that owns the capability.

## Current ownership

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/renderer/components/chat/messages/` | Shared message-list contracts, rendering, actions, tools, markdown, streaming, and list behavior |
| `src/renderer/components/chat/actions/` | Generic action descriptors/registry plus current topic and session action sets |
| `src/renderer/components/chat/{resourceList,shell,panes,flow}/` | Shared resource navigation, conversation shell, auxiliary panes, and topic-tree visualization |
| `src/renderer/components/composer/` | Shared composer surface and its Chat/Agent variants |
| `src/renderer/pages/{home,agents}/messages/` | Page-owned projections from business state into the shared message-list contract |
| `src/main/data/services/MessageService.ts` | SQLite-backed topic-message tree operations and invariants |

The repository previously carried target-architecture documents for a generic
adapter layer and root package barrel. Those APIs did not land; the current
reference set documents implemented behavior only.

## Documents

| Document | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Composer Rich Clipboard](./composer-rich-clipboard.md) | Private clipboard format that preserves composer tokens across copy/paste, its restore rules, and ownership boundaries |
| [Message Tree](./message-tree.md) | The topic message-tree model: adjacency list, virtual root, sibling groups, invariants, delete semantics, consumer contract |
