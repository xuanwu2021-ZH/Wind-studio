# Cache System Overview

Three-tier cache for regenerable data. In-process memory, cross-window shared state, and localStorage-backed persistence.

## Scope

Use Cache for data that:

- Can be regenerated or lost without user impact
- Needs no backup or cross-device sync
- Has lifecycle tied to a component, window, or app session

For user settings use [Preference](./preference-overview.md); for business data use [DataApi](./data-api-overview.md).

## Tiers

| Tier       | Scope                       | Survives restart | Authority                        | Use for                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Memory     | Per-process                 | No               | Local to each process            | Computed results, API responses         |
| Shared     | All renderer windows + Main | No               | Main (relays + conflict sink)    | Cross-window UI state                   |
| Persist (Renderer) | All renderer windows | Yes (localStorage) | Each renderer                | Recent items, non-critical UI state |
| Persist (Main)     | Main process only    | Yes (JSON file)    | Main                         | Loseable main-process state         |

Persist has two **independent** stores. Each **renderer** persists to its own `localStorage`; **Main** persists to its own JSON file (`{userData}/cache.json`) exposed as `getPersist` / `setPersist` / `hasPersist` / `deletePersist` (plus `subscribePersistChange`) on the Main `CacheService`. The two never share data — Main cannot read renderer persist and vice versa. Separately, Main still **relays** renderer-origin `CacheSyncMessage { type: 'persist' }` between windows (it forwards them; it does not store the renderer's persist).

> **Reach for the Main persist tier last.** It was the last tier added, for a deliberately narrow need: small, loseable, **main-process-authoritative** state that genuinely belongs nowhere else. Before choosing it, rule out the better-fitting systems first — a user setting belongs in [Preference](./preference-overview.md); cross-window or renderer-owned UI state belongs in Shared / renderer Persist; business data belongs in [DataApi](./data-api-overview.md). In the vast majority of cases one of those is the right answer, so use Main persist only when the state is owned by the main process, regenerable, and has no home in any other system. See [System Selection](./README.md) for the full decision guide.

## Key Types

| Type     | Example schema                       | Call site                                 | Tiers            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Fixed    | `'app.user.avatar': string`          | `get('app.user.avatar')`                  | Memory / Shared / Persist |
| Template | `'scroll.position.${topicId}': number` | `get('scroll.position.t42')`            | Memory / Shared  |
| Casual   | (none — type argument only)          | `getCasual<T>('my.dynamic.key')`          | Memory only      |

Template keys share one default value across all instances — all `web_search.provider.last_used_key.*` fall back to `''`. Casual keys are blocked at compile time from matching any schema pattern (`UseCacheCasualKey` in `src/shared/data/cache/cacheSchemas.ts:393`).

## Design Invariants

Non-obvious rules the code enforces; assume them when designing consumers.

1. **Same-value write never fires subscribers or re-renders.** Equality via `isEqual` (es-toolkit/compat). It is a full no-op (no broadcast either) only when `expireAt` is also unchanged — a same-value write that moves the TTL still broadcasts to mirrors, see invariant 2. (`src/main/data/CacheService.ts` `isEqual` guards before `broadcastSync` / notifier) — Corollary for the hooks' functional updater `setX(prev => …)`: it must return a **new** value. Mutating `prev` in place and returning the same reference compares the stored value against itself, so this no-op short-circuit silently swallows the update (the hooks type `prev` shallow-readonly to block the common top-level case).
2. **TTL-only refresh does not fire subscribers — but does sync mirrors.** Updating `expireAt` on the same value fires no main value-subscriber and no hook re-render. Main still broadcasts the full entry so every renderer mirror renews its `expireAt` in step; the receiving renderer renews in place, keeping the old value reference (an equal-value heartbeat never causes re-renders).
3. **Subscribers fire only on explicit writes; eviction still reaches mirrors.** Lazy TTL cleanup, the 10-min GC sweep, and `onStop` never fire main value-subscribers. Every Main-origin runtime eviction (lazy TTL cleanup, GC sweep, `deleteShared` hitting an expired entry) still broadcasts one deletion tombstone so renderer mirrors — which have no GC — physically converge; renderer hooks DO re-render on that tombstone (the value visibly disappears). `onStop` clears without broadcasting.
4. **Shared expiry is eventually consistent — never expiry-instant.** External-store snapshots (`getSharedSnapshot`, the reader behind all shared cache hooks) are pure physical reads: no TTL evaluation, no store mutation. An expired entry may briefly keep serving its old value until Main's tombstone lands (next Main read of the key, or the GC sweep — upper bound TTL + 10 min) or this window's own imperative `getShared` evicts it locally. Do not design UI that needs a value to vanish at the TTL instant; `useCache` / `useSharedCache` still warn when a hooked key carries TTL.
5. **Writable hooks pin cache entries.** `registerHook` / `unregisterHook` refcount keys; `delete` / `deleteShared` return `false` while any hook is active. The read-only `useSharedCacheValue` does NOT pin (and never writes a default) — an owner's deletion always passes through observers.
6. **Persist presence means "overridden", not "stored".** Both persist tiers (Main JSON + renderer localStorage) have no absent state — `getPersist` always returns the stored override or the schema default (never undefined). `hasPersist` reports whether the effective value *differs from the default* (i.e. has been overridden), and `deletePersist` resets a key to its default rather than removing it. Keys are fixed by schema. Change subscription differs by process in API shape only: Main exposes a dedicated `subscribePersistChange` (main-local, same model as `subscribeChange`; never relayed to renderers), while the renderer routes persist changes through its unified `subscribe(key, cb)`.
7. **TTL uses absolute `expireAt` (Unix ms).** Every process expires the same entry at the same instant, regardless of clock skew in IPC delivery.
8. **Main-wins convergence.** All cross-window shared writes are serialized through Main; on window init, Main-priority override applies to conflicts with the renderer's pre-sync copy.
9. **Re-entrant callbacks are safe.** Subscribers may write back into the same key; the `isEqual` short-circuit terminates loops once the value stabilizes. Callback errors are caught and logged without skipping other subscribers.
10. **Template placeholders are runtime-anonymous.** `${providerId}` and `${foo}` match identical concrete keys. Dynamic segments match `[\w\-]+` only — dots, colons, and non-ASCII are rejected (`src/shared/data/cache/templateKey.ts:35-46`).

Both channels are sender-gated by `validateSender` (untrusted `Cache_Sync` messages are dropped, `Cache_GetAllShared` rejects) — see [IpcApi Overview §Security](../ipc/ipc-overview.md#security--two-gates).
