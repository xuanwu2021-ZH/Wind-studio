name: find-skills
description: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like "how do I do X", "find a skill for X", "is there a skill that can...", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill.
version: 1.0.0

# Find Skills

This skill helps you discover and install skills from the open agent skills ecosystem.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:

- Asks "how do I do X" where X might be a common task with an existing skill
- Says "find a skill for X" or "is there a skill for X"
- Asks "can you do X" where X is a specialized capability
- Expresses interest in extending agent capabilities
- Wants to search for tools, templates, or workflows
- Mentions they wish they had help with a specific domain (design, testing, deployment, etc.)

## The skill tools

Wind Studio gives you two built-in tools for skills — use them, and do NOT shell out to
`npx skills`, `git`, or any package manager:

- **`search_skills(query)`** — search the marketplace by keyword. Returns matches, each with an
  opaque `install_source` value.
- **`install_skill(install_source)`** — install ONE skill into Wind Studio's managed
  library and enable it for this agent. Wind Studio clones the repo, installs just that one skill,
  and registers it in a single deterministic step. Permission handling follows the active Claude
  permission mode (Step 6).

## How to Help Users Find Skills

### Step 1: Understand What They Need

When a user asks for help with something, identify:

1. The domain (e.g., React, testing, design, deployment)
2. The specific task (e.g., writing tests, creating animations, reviewing PRs)
3. Whether this is a common enough task that a skill likely exists

### Step 2: Check the Leaderboard First

Before running a CLI search, check the [skills.sh leaderboard](https://skills.sh/) to see if a well-known skill already exists for the domain. The leaderboard ranks skills by total installs, surfacing the most popular and battle-tested options.

For example, top skills for web development include:
- `vercel-labs/agent-skills` — React, Next.js, web design (100K+ installs each)
- `anthropics/skills` — Frontend design, document processing (100K+ installs)

### Step 3: Search for Skills

If the leaderboard doesn't cover the user's need, call the `search_skills` tool:

- User asks "how do I make my React app faster?" → `search_skills("react performance")`
- User asks "can you help me with PR reviews?" → `search_skills("pr review")`
- User asks "I need to create a changelog" → `search_skills("changelog")`

Each result includes an opaque `install_source`, source registry, review URL,
install count, and available star count. Pass the exact `install_source` value
to `install_skill`.

### Step 4: Verify Quality Before Recommending

**Do not recommend a skill based solely on search results.** Always verify:

1. **Install count** — Prefer skills with 1K+ installs. Be cautious with anything under 100.
2. **Source reputation** — Official sources (`vercel-labs`, `anthropics`, `microsoft`) are more trustworthy than unknown authors.
3. **GitHub stars** — Check the source repository. A skill from a repo with <100 stars should be treated with skepticism.

### Step 5: Present Options to the User

When you find relevant skills, present them to the user with:

1. The skill name and what it does
2. The install count and source
3. That you can install it for them into Wind Studio
4. A link to learn more at skills.sh

Example response:

```
I found a skill that might help! The "react-best-practices" skill provides
React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering.
(185K installs)

I can install it into Wind Studio's skill library for you — want me to go ahead?

### Step 6: Install (Uses the Active Permission Mode)

**⚠️ Security:** Skills are third-party code that runs with full agent
permissions. A malicious skill could read, modify, or delete files on your
system.

Before installing any skill:

1. **Show a security warning** — tell the user that the skill is third-party
   code and will run with full agent permissions.
2. **Provide a review link** — the skills.sh page (or source repository) so
   the user can review the skill's SKILL.md and any scripts it contains.
3. **Require install intent** — call `install_skill` only when the user asked to install the skill
   or accepted a presented option. A search-only request must not mutate the skill library.

Once the user has expressed install intent, call `install_skill` with the exact `install_source`
from the search result. Do not add another model-level confirmation step: Claude's active permission
mode is the authority. Default and accept-edits modes may prompt through the SDK; bypass-permissions
mode runs directly.

- `install_skill("claude-plugins:vercel-labs/agent-skills/skills/react-best-practices")`

Do **not** run `npx skills add`, `git clone`, or any shell command to install — that would
install the whole repo (dozens of skills), scatter symlinks across other tools, and land
outside Wind Studio's library. `install_skill` installs **only that one skill** into Wind Studio's
managed library in one deterministic step. The Claude Agent SDK applies the configured permission
mode before it runs. Once done it is registered and listed in the app — nothing is left elsewhere.

## Common Skill Categories

When searching, consider these common categories:

| Category        | Example Queries                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Web Development | react, nextjs, typescript, css, tailwind |
| Testing         | testing, jest, playwright, e2e           |
| DevOps          | deploy, docker, kubernetes, ci-cd        |
| Documentation   | docs, readme, changelog, api-docs        |
| Code Quality    | review, lint, refactor, best-practices   |
| Design          | ui, ux, design-system, accessibility     |
| Productivity    | workflow, automation, git                |

## Tips for Effective Searches

1. **Use specific keywords**: "react testing" is better than just "testing"
2. **Try alternative terms**: If "deploy" doesn't work, try "deployment" or "ci-cd"
3. **Check popular sources**: Many skills come from `vercel-labs/agent-skills` or `ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills`

## When No Skills Are Found

If no relevant skills exist:

1. Acknowledge that no existing skill was found
2. Offer to help with the task directly using your general capabilities
3. Offer to author a custom skill for the task (the skill-creator skill handles this)

Example:

```
I searched for skills related to "xyz" but didn't find any matches.
I can still help you with this task directly! Would you like me to proceed?

If this is something you do often, I can author a custom skill for you — just ask
me to "create a skill for <task>" and I'll write one into Wind Studio's skills directory.
```
