/**
 * Builder for the reasoning wire shape most providers use: ONE target, one operation per mode.
 *
 * The literal form is deliberately verbose — five lines to say "write `thinking.type` per mode" — and it
 * repeats across ~20 providers. `modeWire` states the same thing on one line while keeping the wire
 * legible against a vendor's docs, which is what these definitions get reviewed for. Anything richer
 * (several operations per mode, budget policies) stays a plain object literal; this builder is only for
 * the simple majority and intentionally cannot express those.
