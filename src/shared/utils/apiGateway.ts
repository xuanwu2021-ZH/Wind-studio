 * `providerId:apiModelId` address whose model happens to end in "flash" (e.g.
 * `agent/deepseek-v4-flash` → sent as `gemini-3.5-flash`). The suffix makes the
 * string unrecognizable to those checks and rides along verbatim in the request
 * URL; the gateway's Gemini route (and the CLI-config connection readback) strip
 * exactly one trailing sentinel via {@link stripGeminiGatewayModelSuffix}.
 *
 * The suffix is RESERVED: a real gateway model id may not end with it (see
 * {@link isReservedGeminiGatewayModelId}). The gemini `/v1beta/models` list omits
 * such ids and the route rejects them, so a listed model always round-trips to the
 * same address once the suffix is stripped.
