/**
 * Byte-faithful canonical comparison form — or `null` when the path has no

 *
 * The `\` → `/` fold is applied to **Windows drive paths only**. It is not
 * redundant with `canonicalizeFilePath`, which normalizes Windows separators the
 * other way (to `\`); it bridges that form to the `/` form used by the tree
 * layer, `file://` URLs, and the relative paths returned below. It must NOT be
 * applied to POSIX paths: there a backslash is a legal filename character, so
 * folding it would make `/workspace/a\b.txt` — one file named `a\b.txt` — compare
 * equal to `/workspace/a/b.txt`, an entirely different file.
 * `canonicalizeFilePath` already draws this distinction (its POSIX branch splits
 * on `/` only); the job here is to preserve it, not undo it.
 *
 * Two shapes yield `null`, both meaning "not provably anything":
 *
 * - **UNC** (`\\server\share\…`) — a valid `AbsoluteFilePath` that
 *   `canonicalizeFilePath` rejects outright, since `\\server\share` is an
 *   indivisible root that `..` must not escape.
 * - **Leading `//`** — the forward-slash spelling of UNC on Windows, and
 *   implementation-defined on POSIX. `canonicalizeFilePath` collapses the
 *   leading `//` to `/`, so `//server/share/a.txt` would otherwise compare equal
 *   to the unrelated `/server/share/a.txt`. Checked here on the raw input,
 *   because the canonical form no longer carries the distinction. (Collapsing it
 *   inside `canonicalizeFilePath` is arguably the real defect, but that function
 *   produces the persisted `file_entry.externalPath` key and changing its output
 *   requires a paired migration — see its "Rule-evolution discipline". Tracked
 *   in #17429.)
 *
 * These are predicates, not parsers: a path we cannot canonicalize is simply not
 * provably the same as, or inside, anything. So degrade to `null` rather than
 * throwing out of a predicate and taking the caller down with it.
 *
 * Exported because a consumer needing a `Set`/`Map` key, or a comparison looser
 * than `isSamePath`, must reach the same form the primitives compare against —
 * and hand-rolling it is exactly how the conditional fold above gets lost. A
 * consumer that only asks "same?" or "inside?" should use those instead.
