 * Synthetic, page-local provider entry for the "use the CLI's own login" option.
 * It occupies a slot in a login-capable tool's provider list so the option can be
 * selected and reordered exactly like a real provider — but it is never persisted
 * to the providers store and never backs a real request. The row is rendered by
 * `OwnLoginCard` (not `ProviderCard`), so most of these fields are placeholders
 * that never surface in the UI; they exist only to satisfy the `Provider` shape.
