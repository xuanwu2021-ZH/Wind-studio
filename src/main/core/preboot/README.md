# Preboot

Pre-bootstrap phase: code that must run **before** `application.bootstrap()`
is called.

## What is the bootstrap phase?

`application.bootstrap()` is the NestJS/Spring-style orchestration function
that builds the IoC container and runs the lifecycle stages
(Background / BeforeReady / WhenReady). It is the *only* meaning of
"bootstrap" in this codebase.

But some setup must happen even earlier — synchronously, with no lifecycle
services available — because `application.bootstrap()` itself depends on it.
Most importantly: `application.initPathRegistry()` is called from preboot
in `main/main.ts` after userData resolution, the single-instance lock,
Chromium flag setup, and crash telemetry setup. It calls `buildPathRegistry()`
to build a frozen snapshot of the path registry by reading
`app.getPath('userData')` and other Electron paths. So all
`app.setPath('userData', …)` calls must complete **before**
`application.initPathRegistry()` is called, and the registry must be
initialized **before** `application.bootstrap()` (which asserts the registry
exists and refuses to start otherwise).

This directory holds that pre-bootstrap work.

## Membership criteria

Code belongs in `core/preboot/` if **all** are true:

1. It must run before `application.bootstrap()` is called. Running before
   bootstrap is a **timing contract, not directory ownership** — this
   criterion is necessary but never sufficient on its own.
2. It is **non-removable**: the app cannot start correctly without it.
   Removable capabilities — even ones whose execution must happen during
   the preboot phase — live in their nature-home (e.g. `services/`) and
   are invoked from `main.ts` at the right point in the preboot sequence.
3. It only depends on Electron `app` top-level APIs and synchronously-loaded
   modules (e.g. `BootConfigService`, `loggerService`).
4. It directly performs side effects on global state (paths, command-line
   switches) — or is a pure helper that supports a side-effecting preboot
   operation.
5. It does **not** depend on any lifecycle-managed service (anything
   accessed via `application.get(...)`). This is the real hard
   constraint: async preboot code is allowed when necessary, but
   depending on services that only exist after `application.bootstrap()`
   is not.

If any of these is false, the code belongs in a regular service under
`services/` or in a lifecycle-managed module.

## Vocabulary

The v2 main process has three startup phases. This is the preferred
terminology across the codebase — please don't introduce alternative names
without good reason.

- **preboot** — the phase this directory owns: setup code that must run
  before `application.bootstrap()` is called. Typically synchronous, but
  may be async when the operation cannot be expressed synchronously
  (e.g. a v1→v2 migration gate that awaits a DB probe). Preboot modules
  must not depend on any lifecycle-managed service — that is the real
  constraint, not whether the code awaits. This is what an OS or Linux
  developer would call "early boot" or "init phase 0". It is *not* a
  NestJS/Spring concept.
- **bootstrap** — the `application.bootstrap()` orchestration function
  (defined at `src/main/core/application/Application.ts:108`). It builds
  the IoC container and runs the lifecycle stages. NestJS/Spring-style
  terminology, applied consistently across `core/application/`,
  `core/lifecycle/`, and decorators. **Do not confuse** with the
  OS-level "bootstrap = early boot loader" — that meaning is what
  `preboot` covers. The path registry is initialized separately via
  `application.initPathRegistry()` from preboot, **not** inside
  `bootstrap()` — `bootstrap()` only asserts that the registry has
  already been initialized.
- **lifecycle stages** — the substages *inside* `application.bootstrap()`:
  `Background`, `BeforeReady`, `WhenReady` (defined in `core/lifecycle/`).
  These run after preboot and during bootstrap. They are not separate
  top-level phases.
- **running** — steady state after `application.bootstrap()` returns and
  the main window is shown.

### Term: "userData"

Throughout `core/preboot/`, the word **userData** refers exclusively to
Electron's `app.getPath('userData')` directory — the OS-level directory
tree where Chromium and Electron persist their state alongside the
application's own files.

It does **not** mean "user data" in the colloquial sense (用户数据). The
Electron userData directory contains a mix of user content
(`Data/cherrystudio.sqlite`, `Data/Files`, `Data/KnowledgeBase`, …) AND
Chromium runtime state (`Network/`, `Partitions/`, `IndexedDB`,
`Local Storage`, …) AND, on Windows and Linux, application logs
(`logs/` — macOS keeps them in `~/Library/Logs` instead).

```

The directory is intentionally flat. New domains add a sibling file rather
than a subdirectory.

### Development userData suffix

Unpackaged development runs never read the BootConfig userData mapping
(`app.user_data_path`).
Instead, `userDataLocation.ts` appends a suffix to Electron's default
userData directory before the path registry and single-instance lock are
initialized. The default suffix is `Dev`.

Set `CS_DEV_USER_DATA_SUFFIX` to run multiple development instances with
isolated app data and locks. Use `.env` for a persistent local default:

```bash
CS_DEV_USER_DATA_SUFFIX=DevQuito
```

Or pass it inline for a single dev process:

```bash
CS_DEV_USER_DATA_SUFFIX=DevQuito pnpm dev
```

The trimmed suffix is appended to the default path. It must be a single path
component — no path separator, drive colon, Windows-reserved character
(`* ? " < > |`), control character, or trailing dot. Empty or whitespace-only
values fall back to `Dev`; a value breaking those rules aborts startup rather
than falling back, since silently reusing `Dev` would merge an instance meant
to be isolated into the shared dev directories.

### No barrel export

`preboot/` intentionally has no `index.ts` re-export. Consumers must import
each function from its concrete module file:

```ts
import { resolveUserDataLocation } from '@main/core/preboot/userDataLocation'
import { configureChromiumFlags } from '@main/core/preboot/chromiumFlags'
```

Each preboot module has its own timing contract (`userDataLocation` must run
before `initPathRegistry`; `chromiumFlags` must run before
`app.whenReady`).
A barrel export would fold away which function lives in which module — and
therefore which timing rules apply — making the preboot sequence in
`main/main.ts` harder to reason about. Importing from concrete paths keeps
the timing story visible at every call site.
