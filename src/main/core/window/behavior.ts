/**
 * Apply the declarative {@link WindowBehavior} layer to a freshly-created window.
 *
 * This is the non-hacky counterpart to `applyWindowQuirks`: it runs the initial
 * setter calls that Electron's `BrowserWindow` constructor cannot express, and
 * mounts the `blur → hide` listener for {@link WindowBehavior.hideOnBlur}.
 *
 * Call ordering in `WindowManager.createWindow`:
 *
 *   1. `new BrowserWindow(constructorOptions)` — Electron-native setup
 *   2. `applyWindowBehavior(window, behavior, ...)` — initial setters + blur hook
 *   3. `applyWindowQuirks(window, quirks, behavior)` — monkey-patches hide/show
 *
 * Running behavior BEFORE quirks has two intentional effects:
 *   - The initial `setAlwaysOnTop(true, level)` is free of monkey-patch overhead
 *     (first-time setup with no hide/show loop to guard against).
 *   - The blur → `window.hide()` call inherits whatever `quirks` install on
 *     `hide` (macRestoreFocusOnHide, macClearHoverOnHide), because quirks
 *     re-assign `window.hide` after this function returns but the listener
 *     body dereferences `window.hide` at event-fire time.
 *
 * @param window - The BrowserWindow instance
 * @param behavior - The declarative behavior metadata (undefined skips all work)
 * @param id - The WindowManager-assigned windowId (used as override map key)
 * @param getHideOnBlurOverride - Closure returning the runtime override for this
 *   window id (or undefined if unset). Provided by WindowManager — passing a
 *   closure instead of the WM instance keeps this module free of a reverse
 *   dependency.
 * @param windowOptions - The merged WindowOptions used to construct the window.
 *   Consulted to decide whether to re-apply `setAlwaysOnTop` with the
 *   `behavior.alwaysOnTop` level: the initial call is skipped if
 *   `windowOptions.alwaysOnTop !== true`, since Electron did not enable it
 *   during construction and the caller has not opted in.
