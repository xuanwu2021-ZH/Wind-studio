/**
 * Single validation point for `Model.contextWindow` before it feeds any budget.
 *
 * `contextWindow` is `z.number().optional()` — custom / v1-imported / WindAI
 * models really can arrive without it. Every budget in the context-build layer
 * multiplies it, so an absent value used to reach the arithmetic as `NaN`:
 * `Math.min(chars, NaN)` is `NaN`, the truncator's `text.length <= NaN` is
 * always false (so ordinary tool results got offloaded), and the durable /
 * in-loop `trigger` and `keepBudget` became `NaN` too — which disables the very
 * compaction that was supposed to protect the request.
 *
 * Returning `null` is the honest answer for "no window known": callers must
 * then skip window-derived budgets and fall back to the user's absolute
 * character settings, rather than computing a number that is silently wrong.
