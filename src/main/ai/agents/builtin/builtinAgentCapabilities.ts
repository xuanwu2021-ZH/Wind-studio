 * What each built-in Agent is allowed to reach — declared by the Agent, read by the runtimes.

 * runtime, and had already drifted apart. A runtime must not ask which Agent this is; it reads a
 * capability.
 *
 * Declared in TypeScript rather than the bundled `agent.json`: these grant host-level privileges,

 * a data file. `agent.json` stays the Agent's content (identity, instructions, skills).
