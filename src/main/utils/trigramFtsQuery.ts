/**
 * Free-text → FTS query helpers for trigram-tokenized FTS5 tables.
 *
 * The `trigram` tokenizer indexes 3-character windows, which drives how a query
 * is compiled:
 *
 *  - A quoted multi-character string is a *phrase* of trigrams, i.e. a contiguous
 *    substring demand. Space-delimited tokens are already words, but a CJK run
 *    carries no spaces — `extractFtsTokens` returns a whole clause as one token,
 *    and quoting that would demand the entire clause verbatim. CJK runs are
 *    therefore windowed into overlapping trigrams ({@link extractMatchTerms}),
 *    the tokenizer's own unit.
 *  - Indexable terms are OR-ed, not AND-ed: a natural-language question
 *    ("公司的报销流程是什么", "how to configure proxy timeout") carries filler its
 *    target chunk does not contain, so requiring every term returns nothing. OR
 *    lets bm25() rank by how many and how rare the matched terms are.
 *  - Terms shorter than 3 characters produce no trigram and can never MATCH, but
 *    they are often the query's content words — 2-character words dominate
 *    Chinese (「系统」「年假」) — so they must not vanish from the query's
 *    semantics. Callers can AND a `LIKE '%term%'` filter per short term onto the
 *    ranked MATCH ({@link extractShortTerms}), relaxing the filters when they
 *    eliminate every candidate. Only when *nothing* in the query is indexable
 *    (a bare 「天气」) should callers fall back to a pure LIKE scan
 *    ({@link needsLikeFallback} / {@link toFtsLikePattern}).
 *
 * Known tradeoffs, accepted until a real CJK tokenizer replaces trigram in v2.x:
 *
 *  - OR has no minimum-should-match and no stopword handling, so rows sharing
 *    only filler trigrams (「是什么」) enter the candidate set. bm25() usually ranks
 *    the real answer above them, but not reliably; consumers that need a hard
 *    relevance boundary must add one explicitly.
 *  - Windowing covers Han/Hiragana/Katakana only. Thai, Lao, Khmer and Myanmar
 *    are space-less too but are NOT windowed — their clauses keep the
 *    exact-substring semantics; supporting them is deferred with the tokenizer.
